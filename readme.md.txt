This project focuses on designing a database model for a Health Care System. The entities are modelled according to real world entities using the online database creation tool Vertabelo. The project uses all the core concepts of database design and development along with test scenarios with SQL code. The test scenarios are mainly used to depict the reliability of the database system that is designed. The design also addresses potential integrity and security issues of the data that would be inserted into the database. The database design is normalized upto 3rd normal form and a huge piece of data is split into small corresponding columns so that it would be easier to parse in future. Entity relationships like foreign keys are very well defined that correspond to the real world relationships between two entities that are in consideration. For example a relationship between doctors and patients , patients and medications and so on. Later on, several scenarios are presented that provide possible test cases and the reliability of the system designed is depicted by using several complicated SQL queries. The tools used for the design are:
Vertabelo: An online database design tool available for free at http://www.vertabelo.com
Microsoft SQL Management Server: for effective testing and simulation
